- B.Tech, Ocean Engineering, IIT Madras (2025)

# Thesis

- GPU-accelerated large eddy simulations using simplified lattice boltzmann method [[pdf]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18XqFL9qkuXe49q5lFDOUD5B7Z2woCeKZ/view?usp=sharing)
  - Dual Degree Thesis, IIT Madras, 2025
  - Advisor: [Prof. Kameshwarrao Anupindi](https://home.iitm.ac.in/kanupindi/)

# Work experience

- Mechanical Dept, IIT Madras, Graduate Research Assistant, May 2024 - June 2025

  - Advisor: [Prof. Kameshwarrao Anupindi](https://home.iitm.ac.in/kanupindi/)
    - Developed GPU-accelerated LES modules for solver using OpenACC, implementing subgrid-scale (SGS) models and synthetic eddy method for realistic inlet turbulence generation.
    - Conducted validation study comparing SGS models (Smagorinsky, Vreman, WALE, Sigma) for wall-bounded (lid-driven cavity) and free-shear (jet flow) cases, identifying optimal approach.
    - Applied validated models and approach to a model room ventilation flow case, achieving good agreement ( 20% mean deviation error) with experimental data from a reference study.
    - Presented these findings at the international conference on thermofluids [INCOTHERM 2025](https://people.iitism.ac.in/~incotherm2025/home.html).
    
- LMFTEUS, Universite de Sherbrooke, Research Intern, Summer 2023

  - Advisor: [Prof. Sebastian Poncet](https://lmfteus.wordpress.com/team/)
    - Motivation was to develop a carbon dioxide and propane mixture that stays subcritical during separation, offering higher energy efficiency than pure carbon dioxide while reducing flammability risks of pure propane.
    - Conducted Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube experiments with pure carbon dioxide and generated validation data.
    - Simulated pure carbon dioxide for operating conditions from experiments and validated CFD model and numerical procedure. Later
    conducted simulations for carbon dioxide and propane mixture.
    - Conducted a model comparison study for RANS models using Fluent, and found that the k-omega SST with perfect gas equation produced closest results to experimental cold-mass fractions values.

- SkyServe.ai, Remote, India, Machine Learning Intern, Spring 2023

  - Company: [SkyServe.ai](https://www.skyserve.ai/)
    - Collaboratively developed a UNet-based building detection solution on Sentinel-2 data, utilizing a pre-trained ResNet50 encoder under
    guidance from a former ISRO group director.
    - Enhanced dataset quality by 5% by refining ROI selection and automating diverse Sentinel-2 image extraction via Google Earth Engine to mitigate model bias.
    - Integrated the optimized model into the company’s website for real-time predictions, aligning with required needs after an extensive literature review and different architectures exploration.
