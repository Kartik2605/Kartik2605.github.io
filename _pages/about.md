I am currently a final year dual degree student at IIT Madras, pursuing an integrated program in Computational Engineering. My primary research interests lie in computational methods for turbulence physics and optimisation problems, with a strong focus on their applications to real-world engineering challenges. I am passionate about data-driven and hybrid methodologies that combine deep learning with traditional models to advance solutions in this domain. I have worked on in-house CFD codes, implementations based on LBM, FNPT-RANS coupled solver. I have also co-founded a student team at IIT Madras that designs and builds solar-powered car, representing India in international competitions such as the World Solar Challenge.



My dual degree thesis project is based on particle laden flow simulations in Simple and Highly Stable Lattice Boltzmann Method based solver:

- Sub-grid scale models copling and validation
- Single Jet flow simulations with synthetic eddy method for inlet tubulence
- Particle flow simulations with one way coupling and validation
- Study particle distribution over time in jet flows for size distributions

**I am currently looking for PhD positions (Fall - 2025)**.


Outside of my academic pursuits, I like to spend time painting. I like sketching and in acrylic medium, have also explored madala artform and you can find my artworks on my [pinterest](https://pin.it/2c8Ym5D8z) profile.
I also like playing musical instruments like the ukulele, tabla, cajon and also playing sports mostly badminton and cricket. I take pride in giving back to community by mentoring jee aspirants & juniors and have been part of NGO [Avanti Fellows](https://www.avantifellows.org/) as a mentor.
