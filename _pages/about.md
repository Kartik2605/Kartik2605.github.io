I completed dual degree with bachelors in Ocean engineering and integrated masters in Computational engineering from IIT Madras. My primary research interests lie in developement of numerical methods for high-fidelity simulation of turbulence physics. I am also very interested in data-driven approaches like data-assimilation and surrogate modeling to utlise the data from high-fidelity simulations to advance predictive capabilities in simulation solutions.

My dual degree thesis project was based on GPU-accelerated large eddy simulations using Simple and Highly Stable Lattice Boltzmann method :

- parallelised implementation of sub-grid scale models
- Comparision study of SGS models and validation for wall-bounded flow (lid driven cavity case at Re 12k)
- Validation for free shear flow (circular jet flow case at Re 8.4k)
- Application of validated model and optimal simulation approach to indoor model room ventilation case

- **I am currently looking for PhD positions (Fall - 2026)**.

In addition to my research, I like playing musical instruments like tabla, ukulele, cajon. I am also into sketching, acrylic painting, playing badminton, chess, reading, and watching movies and web series. You can find some of my artwork on my [pinterest](https://pin.it/2c8Ym5D8z).
