I am an incoming Phd candidate in Mechanical & Aerospace engineering department at Monash university, Australia. I completed bachelors in Ocean engineering and integrated masters in Computational engineering at IIT Madras. My primary research interests lie in high-fidelity simulation methods for turbulence physics, with a strong focus on their applications to real-world engineering challenges. I am also very excited about data-driven methodologies like data assimilation that combine deep learning with traditional models to advance solutions in this domain.


My dual degree thesis project was based on GPU-accelerated large eddy simulations using Simple and Highly Stable Lattice Boltzmann method :

- parallelised implementation of sub-grid scale models
- Comparision study of SGS models and validation for wall-bounded flow (lid driven cavity case at Re 12k)
- Validation for free shear flow (circular jet flow case at Re 8.4k)
- Application of validated model and optimal simulation approach to indoor model room ventilation case

In addition to my research, I like playing musical instruments like tabla, ukulele, cajon. I am also into sketching, acrylic painting, playing badminton, chess, reading, and watching movies and web series. You can find some of artwork on my [pinterest](https://pin.it/2c8Ym5D8z).
