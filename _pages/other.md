# Interests and Hobbies

## Sports: ##

* **Formula 1** - I started watching F1 since 2018 and this was one of the things which motivated me to be part of project Agnirath. The amount of engineering which goes on in cutting down a fraction of second in the lap time and improvements done every year in the car has always fascinated me. Adjusting elements such as front-wing angles, toe, and suspension setups for each circuit while pushing the boundaries of innovation within the regulations—like the revolutionary DAS system by Mercedes, showcases its true pinnacle of motorsports. My favorite constructor has been [Mercedes-AMG Petronas](https://www.mercedesamgf1.com/) and Lewis Hamilton is my favorite driver on the grid. I also ocassionaly watch MotoGP, Formula E.

* **Badminton** - I learnt playing badminton during high school and had been part of the school team. I fell in love with the speed and intensity of the game. I re-started working on my game during my undergradute with some of my friends.

* **Chess** - I've recently started playing chess, and I'm really enjoying it — especially the thrill and addictive feeling you get after winning a few matches. If you'd like to play together, you can find me on Chess.com ([cosmic_26](https://www.chess.com/member/cosmic_26)).

* **Other Sports** - I have played cricket since childhood and ocasionally follow it (ICC tournaments). Represented school team at couple of competetive events as a right arm off-spinner. I also like to play video games like RDR2, COD.


## Painting: ##

- I generally like painting naturescape & natural environment in acrylic medium. I also do pencil sketchings and have tried mandala art form. I was part of fine arts at National Cultures and Arts Organisation of IIT Madras during my undergrad. Can check out some of work on [pinterest](https://pin.it/2c8Ym5D8z). Most of the paintings linked there are from the pandemic break.

## Reading and Cinema: ##

* **Books** - I like to read sometimes. I enjoy biographies, fictions, non-fictions. Some of the best reads I had so far were Shoe Dog, Dan brown's series on character Robert Langdon (Origin is my favourite of them), Chaos by James Gleick and few more.

* **Movies** - I am not a cinephile but most times I love to watch movies or webseries instead reading. My playlist has generes from sci-fictions, dramas to comedy, sitcoms. Some of my favourites include Arrival, Interstellar, Mission impossible series; Dark, Narcos, Game of thrones web series and many more. Big Bang Theory is my favourite sitcom.

## Music: ##

* **Instruments** - I learnt to play the tabla from my school teacher and then later took professional training. I learnt a few years in hindustani classical style. Later during my undergrad, I started learning ukulele. It was first time I started with string instruments. I also played cajon at an event. I would definitely like to learn a few other instruments like drums and piano sometime.

* **Bands/Artists** - My playlist has genres ranging from pop to classical music. My favorite artists include Ed Sheeran, Arjit Singh, Pritam, Imagine Dragon, Eminem and many more. Along with this, I also like theme songs and scores from Hans Zimmer, Brian Tyler ([F1 theme!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AYy-BcjRXg)).

<!-- ### Concerts:
