excerpt: "In this blog, I share my journey of applying to universities for PhD positions across US, Europe and Australia based universities & labs. The journey ranged from listining to “Lose Yourself” by Eminem while drafting statement of purpose & preparing for interviews to “Co2” by Prateek Kuhad when dealing with rejections."
