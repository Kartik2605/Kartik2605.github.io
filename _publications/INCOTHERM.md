In this study, high-fidelity turbulent flow simulations are conducted using the simple and highly stable lattice Boltzmann method (SHSLBM) coupled with large-eddy simulation (LES). The SHSLBM-LES framework is thoroughly validated against standard benchmark cases, including three-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow at Reynolds number 12000 and circular jet flow at Reynolds number 8400. A comprehensive comparison of four different subgrid-scale (SGS) models - Smagorinsky, Vreman, WALE, and Sigma is performed to evaluate their performance in capturing turbulent dynamics. The performance of different SGS models are analyzed with particular attention to their ability to predict near-wall behavior. The framework is then applied to a model room ventilation case (Re = 609) with inlet and outlet configurations. It simulates realistic airflow patterns, with turbulence intensity at the inlet set to 5%. Key findings highlight the WALE and Vreman modelâ€™s superiority in wall-bounded flows due to their near-wall scaling. The Sigma model demonstrates robust performance across tested regimes. The present work demonstrates the potential of accelerated SHSLBM-LES frameworks for high-fidelity simulations of complex turbulent flows, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of different SGS models while leveraging the computational efficiency of GPU architecture.

The paper soon to be published in the SCOPUS-indexed Springer Conference Proceedings, Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering and will link it here once available.
